    "weeks": [
      {
        "week": 1,
        "title": "Resisting Temptation",
        "days": [
          {
            "day": 1,
            "title": "Stewardship of Beauty",
            "content": "Beauty is a gift from God...",
            "questions": [
              {
                "question": "What does this verse say about Josephâ€™s special physical appearance?",

          }
